I'm in the process of making HappyFunTimes into a platform! What does that
mean? It means I want the following

<ul>
<li>A user facing installer for OSX and Windows

That means the user can just download some file and install it and start playing games with friends</li><p></p>
<li><p>An App Store

Running HappyFunTimes will present some UI similar to XBox/PS3/XBoxOne/PS4 where you can pick installed games, 
browse for more, install them.</p></li>
</ul>

I could use lots of help &#9786;

The basic parts.

<ul>
<li>Need to make native installers for HappyFunTimes</li>
<li>Need to make store UI</li>
<li>Need to make it possible to easily install games from store (guessing a custom extension handler might work)</li>
<li>Need to setup database of games</li>
<li>Need to make individual games installable</li>
</ul>

Yes there are a lot of details but I don't think it's too big a project. I'm
planning to leverage as much as I can on existing stuff. For example maybe I
can use npm to manage the games.
