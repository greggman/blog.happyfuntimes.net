[superhappyfuntimes.net](http://superhappyfuntimes.net) IS NOW LIVE!

Like I mentioned previously I'm pretty worried it can't handle the traffic
because it's using meteor. I'd like to re&minus;write it to just be as simple
as possible but it's time I don't have at the moment so I'll cross my fingers.

It's version "super&minus;alpha" which means I'm sure there's 1000+ issues. You
can seem some of them listed in the [todo](https://github.com/greggman/HappyFunTimes/blob/master/todo.md) file in the repo. I'm sure I should be using issues or trello or something
else to track todo's but at the moment since it's only me I find editing a text
file a lot easier. If people start contributing I'll have to move to something
else.

But, that said, it does seem to work. The steps to run are probably less than
obvious though. Listed below

<ol>
<li><a href="http://superhappyfuntimes.net/install">Download HFT and install it</a> (see note below!)</li>
<li>Run it</li>
<li>Click the link for "superhappyfuntimes.net"</li>
<li>Install a game </li>
<li>Launch the game</li>
<li>Make sure your phone and friends phones are on the <strong>SAME NETWORK</strong> as your computer.</li>
<li>On the phone go to <a href="http://happyfuntimes.net">happyfuntimes.net</a></li>
</ol>

That's it.

So many things to do and so many ways to make it smoother that I have to work
on but it seems to work

Note: Please if you made a game [migrate it to the new system](https://github.com/greggman/HappyFunTimes/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrate-from-0xx-to-1xx) so you can post it on the gallery.

NOTE: On Windows 8 (and 7?) Windows will block installation. Windows now
requires your code to be signed. Signing costs $200&minus;$500 or if you're
lucky you can get a free signature for open source project. I've applied but I
haven't heard back yet. Hopefully I get that issue solved. For now, after you
download the installer, you'll have to go to your `Downloads` folder and double click it. You'll probably get a message something like

<img src="/blog/images/windows-protection-racket.jpg" alt="Windows Protection" title="Windows Protection" />

Click "More" and you'll see this.

<img src="/blog/images/windows-warning.jpg" alt="Windows Warning" title="Windows Warning" />

Click "Run Anyway". After that you'll have to find HappyFunTimes. On the start
screen there's a tiny message at the bottom

<img src="/blog/images/windows-new-apps.jpg" alt="Windows New Apps" title="Windows Apps" />

After that you'll find it under `H`

If I'm lucky adding the signature I mentioned above will remove some of these
steps.
